**Scrooge Coin** A simplified cryptocurrency that publish all history transactions in a blockchain which digitally signed by Scrooge.

**Consensus from trust** A distributed consensus algorithm given a graph of “trust” relationships between nodes. This is an alternative method of resisting sybil attacks and achieving consensus; it has the benefit of not “wasting” electricity like proof-of-work does.

**Blockchain** Implementation of blockchain node that’s part of a block-chain-based distributed consensus protocol. Specifically, the node receives incoming transactions and blocks and maintain an updated blockchain.
